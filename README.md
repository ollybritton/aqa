# AQA++
`AQA++` is an implementation of the [AQA psuedocode specification](https://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/computing/AQA-8520-TG-PC.PDF) in Go. It also supports some features that aren't in the spec (such as hashmaps) in order to make it slightly more usable, hence the `++` in the name.

It is interpreted, much like Python, and the design of the interpreter is based on the one described in the book [Writing An Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).
